# UnityVR
A basic visualization of the Clemson Immersive Space developed for personal learning with the Virtual Reality Toolkit (VRTK) package. The project includes a to-scale environment with walls, windows, and furniture modeled after the Clemson Immersive Space. Users may switch between two interaction modes:
1. Sliding movement, where furniture may be rearranged for planning and may only rotate in the XZ plane; and
2. Free movement, where furniture may be freely picked up and moved around the room.

Uses photo assets as well as 3D models created in Google Blocks. Explored grabbing and movement physics with VRTK while relying on Git version control.
